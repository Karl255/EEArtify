# Tutorial

The AllBlocks image is the minimap screenshot that contains all your blocks (or only the blocks you want to use for the image).
The input image is the image you want to convert and the output image is where the converted image should be saved.
The algorithms are how the best color is found. They're sorted by the complexity and speed (deltaE76 being simple and fast and deltaE2000 being complex and slow). DeltaE 76 is often good enough, but images with a lot of the details being dark pixels, you should use somethig else.
To start the process, just click on the Start button. A message box will pop up and play a sound when the conversion is finished.
